Final Project README file

There are three files in this upload (excluding this README):

- Christopher Lang STA9690 Final Project.pdf
  The presentation PDF file

- finalproject_source_code
  A zipfile of 7 R source file scripts, for both training and visual generation.
  This was split due to the shear size of the code base

- spambase dataset.zip
  The original and processed spambase data. The original is within the original
  directory. It had two files, one for the numeric values, and another with
  a description of the data and, most importantly, column names

  The processed and cleaned version is the CSV file, which simply adds the
  column names into the data and saves it as a more common data format
