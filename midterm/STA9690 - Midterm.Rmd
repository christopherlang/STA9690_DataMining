## Question 1

### Part A

> Prove that $E[y]=X\beta{}^*$ and $Cov[y]=\sigma^2I$

**We know the following:**

* $E[\epsilon{}]=0$
* $Cov[\epsilon{}]=\sigma^2I$

Using the distributive property of the **expectation operator** we define the following:
$$y=X\beta^*+\epsilon$$
$$E[y]=E[X\beta^*]+E[\epsilon]$$
$$E[y]=E[X\beta^*]+0$$
$$E[y]=E[X\beta^*]$$

$X$ is a fixed quantity, while $\beta^*$ is a known quantity **that does not vary** (though we don't know what the value is, we know it is a population parameter). If so, they are both constant values (constant matrix, constant vector, respectively), and by the expectation property of $E[a]=a$ we have the following:

$$E[y]=X\beta^*$$

Similarly, to find $Cov[y]$ we note that the covariance of a single random variable is the same as the variance of that random variable by the property of covariance:
$$Cov[Y]=\sigma^{2}_{Y}$$
Since we are only looking at a single random variable $y$, the **covariance operator** is equivalent to the **variance operator**. Therefore, all of the variance operator is applicable:

$$Cov[Y]=Cov[X\beta^*+\epsilon]$$
Since both $X$ and $\beta^*$ are constants, they are dropped by the variance operator:

$$Cov[Y]=Cov[\epsilon]$$
And by the known defintion of $Cov[\epsilon{}]=\sigma^2I$
$$Cov[Y]=\sigma^2I$$

\newpage

### Part B

**We know the following:**

* $v\in\mathbb{R}^p$ is a vector such that $Xv=0$
* $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ is a $n\times p$ real matrix of predictor variables

If $Xv=0$ is true than the vector $v=0$ is guaranteed to be a solution out of many possible solutions

If so, then $\hat{\beta}+c.v$ is also a minimizer for any $c\in\mathbb{R}$ as:

$\hat{\beta}+c.v=\hat{\beta}$ if $v=0$ for **any** $c\in\mathbb{R}$

### Part C
If the matrix $X$ has completely linear independent columns, than the matrix is full column rank and has a unique solution for $Xv=0$, and the solution for $v$ is $v=0$
